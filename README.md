# Alt+click+drag to move windows in Windows
Better not use that MS crap at all. But if you **REALLY** have to:
  1. install autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
  2. create *.ahk file
  3. copy code to the file
  4. run .ahk file with autohotkey
  5. you can now use alt+drag to move windows just like in linux
